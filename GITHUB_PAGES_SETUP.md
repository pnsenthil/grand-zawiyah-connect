## ðŸ“‹ Manual GitHub Pages Setup

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/pnsenthil/grand-zawiyah-connect
2. Click on **"Settings"** tab (top right of repository page)
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **"Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. Select **"main"** branch and **"/ (root)"** folder
6. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Deploy the Built Files
Since we have a built `dist` folder, you need to:

1. **Option A: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
   - Go to **"Actions"** tab in your repository
   - Click **"New workflow"**
   - Choose **"Deploy static content to GitHub Pages"**
   - Use this workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

2. **Option B: Manual Upload**
   - Go to **"Actions"** tab
   - Click **"New workflow"**
   - Choose **"Set up a workflow yourself"**
   - Copy the workflow above
   - Commit the workflow
